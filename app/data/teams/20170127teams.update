{"id":"10107","blurb":"A League of Their Own team number 10107 is a brand new First Tech Challenge (FTC) team at Linn-Mar High School. Our team is made up of 50% females. We chose our name from the movement during WWII when the owners of baseball teams started a womanâ€™s baseball league to keep baseball alive, while the men were away at war. This movement helped change Americans view of women in the working world. Because many companies are trying to increase the numbers of females engineers. We are very excited to have a team represent what companies today are striving to do. The team is excited to start this build season and building our team.","contact_email":"aloto10107@gmail.com","contact_twitter":"ALoTO_Ftc"}
